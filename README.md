# I’m Something of a Painter Myself
## Use GANs to create art - will you be the next Monet?

### [Kaggle Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/gan-getting-started)

#### BGU Course: Deep Learning and its applications to Signal and Image Processing and Analysis - 2022


Our goal for this project was to take the Kaggle challenge named: ‘I’m Something of a Painter Myself’[1], and to produce Claude Monet paintings. 
Given unpaired datasets, we examined a few options for this purpose and later focused on the GAN architecture. More specifically, we honed in on CycleGAN, which can translate between two image domains (Monet paintings and ‘regular’ photos) by having two generators and two discriminators. 
The trained model generated realistic paintings while achieving great MiFID results. The work that we have done in the scope of work shows the possibility of using CycleGAN in different challenges such as style-transfer. Concluding this project, the results were impressive and stood at a score of 38.
